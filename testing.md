## [Component Testing](./webapp/component-testing.md)

Individual Vue Components should also be documented and tested properly. This guarantees that they are reusable and the api gets more solid in the process.

## [Unit Testing](./backend/unit-testing.md)

Expecially the Backend relies on Unit Tests, as there are no Vue Components.
