### Clone your new Repository

Set the current working folder to the path in which the backend repository should be cloned (copied).

```bash
$ cd PATH-FOR-NITRO-BACKEND
```

For cloning your new repository to your local machine modify the following command to add your GitHub user name.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="HTTPS" %}
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Nitro-Backend.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="SSH" %}
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Nitro-Backend.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Change into the new folder:

```bash
$ cd Nitro-Backend
```

### Copy Environment Variables

```bash
$ cp .env.template .env
```

Configure the file `.env` according to your needs and your local setup.


## Installation and Usage with Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
TODO: How to install Docker for Human Connection …
(Also maybe there should be a main docker installation guide for the whole system at once!?)
{% endhint %}

For further informations see also our [Docker documentation](docker.md).


## Local Installation

Make sure that you have a recent version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed before you proceed. E.g. we have the following versions:

```sh
$ yarn --version
1.12.3
$ npm --version
6.4.1
```

If the `yarn` or `npm` command is unknown you may use the [docker installation](#installation-and-usage-with-docker) (see above) or contact the developer team at [Discord](https://discord.gg/6ub73U3) if you have any questions:

This will start the GraphQL service \(by default on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)\) where you can issue GraphQL requests or access GraphQL Playground in the browser.

{% hint style="warning" %}
But before you can issue GraphQL requests or access GraphQL Playground you have to install, start and seed your Neo4j database. See next step …
