# Disaster Recovery

We tested a couple of options how to do disaster recovery in kubernetes. First,
there is the [offline backup strategy](./neo4j-offline-backup/README.md) of the
community edition of Neo4J, which you can also run on a local installation.
Next up is a kubernetes specific disaster recovery tool called
[Velero](./velero/README.md).
