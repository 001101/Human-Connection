# Testing Guide

## Integration Testing

To test the all peaces together from the user perspective, we use integration tests. They also show if the the backend and the frontend are working as expected in conjunction and also if the browser likes our app.

## Component Testing

Individual Vue Components should also be documented and testet properly. This guaranties they they are reusable and the api gets more solid in that process.

## Unit Testing

Expecially the Backend relies on Unit Tests as there are no Vue Components.
